# README

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 3.0.1

* Rails version: 7.0.0

* Libraries: Boostrap. I followed the steps of this video from the Gorails community: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxKDTtuKOo4&t=42s&ab_channel=GoRails

* Configuration: Same as the video.

* Database creation: rake db:create

* Database initialization: In my case i have to write: "sudo service postgresql restart" everytime i want to start the project, but i think it has to do with the fact that i'm usin WSL2

* How to run the test suite: bin/dev

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Developed using Windows Subsystem for Linux v2.0 - Ubuntu 20.04
